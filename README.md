# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the Horiseon website to make it more accessible in order to remain in compliance with accessiblity standards. Horiseon is committed to providing the best web experience for all potential and current clients. 

In refactoring the website, I learned more about semantic elements and how to appropriately update the css stylesheet based on changes to html elements. I've also added a favicon and a link in the title to ensure the webpage viewer can get back to the homepage in the event that additional pages are added to the website.

Challenges for this project were identifying which semantic element to include and where. Research indicates that there is no correct answer as to whether or not an article element can be contained in a section element or vice versa; but when do you know to use article instead of section? At what point is it best to just utilize the divider element?

Future implementations should include responsiveness updates.
